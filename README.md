quiver-binary
=============

This package provides inter-operability between the _[quiver]_
stream-processing library and the _[binary]_ serialisation library.

Using this you can efficiently encode/decode native Haskell values in
a streaming fashion.

This is especially useful when combined with the _[quiver-bytestring]_
library for I/O.
